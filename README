Plan for a PROV-JSON toolbox that falicitates accessing and manipulating PROV-JSON structures:

In conjunction with the PROV-JSON specifications provided in this document, a PROV-JSON toolbox is being developed to facilitate working with PROV-JSON structures. The toolbox will provide the following functionalities:
Querying: query support for
 - properties of an element or a relation,
 - elements and relations based on their types, and
 - inluding/excluding specific types of elements/relations.
Traversing: the toolbox presents a PROV-JSON structure as a provenance graphs of elements linked by their relations. By so doing, it provides a number of ways to traverse the graph from one element.
Simple inference: transivity closure support for transitive relations in PROV-DM
Editing: creating and updating provenance graphs
Typed literals: handle popular data types (e.g. XSD) and provide extension points for apllication-specific data types
UI widgets: generic Javescript UI widgets to support the functionalities above
